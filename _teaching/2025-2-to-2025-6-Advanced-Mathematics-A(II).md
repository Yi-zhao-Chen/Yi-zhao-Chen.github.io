This is a course for students who major in physics, electronic engineering, and Compter Science. It is aimed at introducing students to the theories of multi integral, series, ODE and improper integral, and at providing them with mathematical foundations for further study. The text book is [《高等数学-下册》（第三版） by Zhong Li (李忠)](/assets/pdf/高等数学(第三版)下册-李忠,周建莹-北京大学出版社.pdf).

My job includes conducting recitation sessions, collecting and grading assignments, proctoring the exams, and grading the exam papers.

The supplementary materials that I delivered in the recitation session can be found via [this link](https://github.com/Dale-X-Lee/Notes-on-Advanced-Mathematics/tree/main/Spring-2025-Advanced-Math-2).
