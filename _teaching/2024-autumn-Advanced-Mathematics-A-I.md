This is a course for students who major in physics, electronic engineering, and Compter Science. It is aimed at introducing students to the theories of single-variable calculus, multivariable differential calculus and vector algebra, and at providing them with mathematical foundations for further study. The text book is [《高等数学-上册》（第三版） by Zhong Li (李忠)](/assets/pdf/高等数学(第三版)上册-李忠,周建莹-北京大学出版社.pdf).

The supplementary materials that I delivered in the recitation session can be found via [this link](https://github.com/Yi-zhao-Chen/Notes-on-Advanced-Mathematics/tree/main/Autumn-2024-Advanced-Math-1).
