title: Proof of the Hodge Decomposition on Riemannian Manifolds(In Chinese)
date: 2024-11-19 00:01:16
description: 'This note records a proof of Hodge decomposition on Riemannian manifolds. We view the Laplacian as the square of a Dirac operator, which is unbounded and self-adjoint. And we prove the theorem by showing that its "inverse" is compact.'
